iPhone Game Name: DogDreamer

Estimated Hours Spent in Creation: ~24hrs

Created By: Thomas Colligan



*Note: I would have used the iPhone's accelerometer to control the Dog's movements instead of arrow keys on screen, but 
I do not own an iPod Touch or iPhone, so I had to do all of the game testing through the iPhone Simulator instead.



Info: This game was created as test to apply to a game developer position at another company. I was supplied with a variety 
of art assets and told to create an iPhone Game Prototype using them. Here are the results:



Test Assets Used:
